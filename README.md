# Basic-AI-Systems
This was created as part of a coursework for my Advanced AI Systems module.

The task was to compare different AI models and compare the results. I compared a convolutional model with a convolution model with dropout layers, and also looked at the different performances given when using ReLU and TanH activation layers
